# CS32 - Chiness copies of STM32F103

Here are some notes on how to deal with these beasts. If you got this chip then I suppose you have baught BluePill on Aliexpress where some unfair sellers don't claim clearly enougth that the boards are based on a clone of STM32 MCUs.

You can debug these chips with OpenOCD. To do it you have to change idcode of the device in OpenOCD configuration. Original STM32F103 chip has `0x1ba01477`, but CS32 has `0x2ba01477`. So the simplest way is to find config file `stm32f1x.cfg` and relpace this idcode. Or create a new config for that case and replace a value.

stlink gdbserver that is shipped with TrueStudio or STMCubeIDE doesn't work with these chips. When connected, it outputs an error stating that it cannot authenticate the chip. I think it is possible to make it work by modifying stlink utility [sources](https://github.com/stlink-org/stlink) and rebuilding it.
